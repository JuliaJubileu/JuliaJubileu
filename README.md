🌱 I’m currently learning Ruby, Ruby on Rails, TDD and code best practices on [TreinaDev](https://www.treinadev.com.br/home).

🚀 I’m currently working on my final project for the course, a tech focused job board. See [here](https://github.com/JuliaJubileu/job-board-td5).

🎯	My next goal is to begin writing about code related stuff to share my progress with the world.
